Directed bi-weights test (3 vertices: A,B,C)
Edges saved as directed entries with independent weights.
Vertices:
0:A (100,100)
1:B (200,100)
2:C (300,100)

Edges (u->v, weight):
0->1 (5)
1->0 (2)
1->2 (-3)

Expectations:
- After load: three directed edges as above.
- Dijkstra Path (A->B) cost 5.
- Dijkstra Path (B->A) cost 2.
- Bellman-Ford Path (B->C) cost -3.
- Bellman-Ford detects no negative cycle.
- Clicking the line between A and B with Highlight Tool highlights BOTH directions.
- Clicking the arrow head near B on edge A->B highlights ONLY A->B.
- Remove Tool: line click removes BOTH directions between A and B; arrow click near B removes ONLY A->B.
